# gradle-skeleton-project
Project for setting up multi-module project. Use for a quick project setup.

Project contains a basic root project with no additional modules. It contains version catalogues from third party and 
project versions (libs.versions.toml) and organizational services (organization.versions.toml).

BuildSrc is used to define all project conventions and to avoid resolving configuration on every build.
